## About

I started out my career as a mechanical engineer but got interested in software in my last job when I wrote a visualisation tool using Python and [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) (more info).

When I realized that I was spending more time working on visualization program than on the  experiments that the visualization program was built for, I decided to pursue software developement fulltime. 

From February to June 2020, I attended [App Academy](https://www.appacademy.io/) (web development bootcamp, 3% acceptance rate). I am currently working on personal projects and seeking a developer position.
